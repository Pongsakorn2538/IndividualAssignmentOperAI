# EDA Findings and Data Cleaning Strategy Documentation

## Introduction
Before developing any analytical or predictive models, it is essential to thoroughly understand the dataset. This section presents key insights uncovered through exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Air Quality dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 

In general, we first replace the default placeholder for missing values (âˆ’200) with actual null values (NaN) to more accurately reflect the true nature of the data. All EDA is then conducted exclusively on the training dataset to prevent data leakage and maintain the integrity of model evaluation.

## EDA Findings 

1.	**Null Value**
    The dataset uses -200 as the default placeholder for missing values. We first replaced all instances of -200 with actual null values and conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns in the missing data. Ultimately, we chose to forward-fill the missing values using the previous valid observation, as this approach preserves daily and weekly trends.

    Moreover, since NMHC(GT) contains high null values (83.90%), we decided to drop this pollutant from our analysis. And because the ground truth of NMHC contains a lot of null values, we cannot validate the sensor related to it, then we also drop PT08.S2NMHC from our analysis.

2.	**Distribution**
    Based on the distribution plot, we can notice that most of the data follow Gaussian distribution except for CO(GT), C6H6(GT), NOx(GT). The criteria is that if skewness is more than 1, we will determine the data is not following Gaussian distribution. This suggests that for these skewed features, we may need to apply some transformation to make it follow Gaussian distribution before modeling.

3.	**Pair Plot**
    Based on the pair plot, we can observe that most of the data are linearly related to each other, especially among the pollutant concentrations. This suggests that models well-suited for capturing linear dependencies, such as linear regression, may be effective for this dataset. Alternatively, it also indicates that certain pollutants could serve as useful predictors for estimating the concentrations of others.

4.	**Correlation heatmap between different pollutants**
    Based on the heat map of correlation, we can observe that there are high correlations between the pollutant concentrations and its sensor readings. This suggests that we need to handle multicollinearity when we build a regression model.

5.	**Time-series plots of CO, NOx, and Benzene concentrations**
    Based on the time-series plots for each pollutant, we can observe fluctuations over time but no clear long-term trend. This suggests that when building a SARIMA model, the trend component can likely be omitted. Alternatively, the ADF test can be conducted under the assumption of a constant mean without a trend.

6.	**Daily/weekly patterns (average by hour of day, day of week)**
    Based on the daily and weekly patterns, we observe significant variations throughout the day and across different days of the week. This suggests that missing values should be filled using the previous valid observation, as this method helps preserve both hourly and weekly trends in the data.
    
    - Hourly Trend

7.	**Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots**
    Based on the autocorrelation plots, we observe that past values have a strong relationship with current values, indicating temporal dependence in the data. The partial autocorrelation plots further confirm that a few recent lags contribute significantly to the current value. This suggests that incorporating lagged features into our model is important for capturing the underlying time-dependent structure of the data, and that time series models like SARIMA are well-suited for this task.

8.	Decomposition of time series into trend, seasonality, and residuals
    Based on the decomposition of the time series into trend, seasonality, and residuals both 24 lags and 168 lags, we observe clear seasonal patterns and some level of noise, but no strong long-term trend. This suggests that modeling efforts should focus on capturing seasonal effects and minimizing residual variance, while the trend component can be considered omitted.
